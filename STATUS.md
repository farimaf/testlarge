For the purpose of this submission, we are applying for the **Available** badge.
The reason we are applying for this badge is that the source code for Oreo, and the trained deep neural network model used by it, are located at a public repository (GitHub) and are accessible to anyone who wants to use them. We are also providing the data related to the evaluation of Oreo (both recall and precision), and also the input files used by it in this submission package. The raw data used in evaluating the recall of Oreo, which includes Oreoâ€™s clone pairs and the clone pairs reported by the tools compared to Oreo, are also provided on Google Drive (they are not in the submission package due to their huge sizes which is about 7GB). In addition to this, we are providing the documentation and guidelines needed for executing Oreo: a step by step installation file is provided with this submission that eases the use of Oreo.
